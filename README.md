## Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to help me grow in the field of data analytics. I will be posting projects that I am working on, or have completed, and hope to gain more insight/constructive feedback on how to go about improving my skills.

This will also be my portfolio where I can show how much I've been able to grow throughout different projects.
